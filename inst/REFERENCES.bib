isbn = {4431559779},
publisher = {Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated},
edition = {1st},
abstract = {This is the first comprehensive book on information geometry, written by the founder of the field. It begins with an elementary introduction to dualistic geometry and proceeds to a wide range of applications, covering information science, engineering, and neuroscience. It consists of four parts, which on the whole can be read independently. A manifold with a divergence function is first introduced, leading directly to dualistic structure, the heart of information geometry. This part (Part I) can be apprehended without any knowledge of differential geometry. An intuitive explanation of modern differential geometry then follows in Part II, although the book is for the most part understandable without modern differential geometry. Information geometry of statistical inference, including time series analysis and semiparametric estimation (the NeymanScott problem), is demonstrated concisely in Part III. Applications addressed in Part IV include hot current topics in machine learning, signal processing, optimization, and neural networks. The book is interdisciplinary, connecting mathematics, information sciences, physics, and neurosciences, inviting readers to a new world of information and geometry. This book is highly recommended to graduate students and researchers who seek new mathematical methods and tools useful in their own fields.}

abstract = {Abstract Conditional autoregressive (CAR) models are useful to obtain a multivariate joint distributions of a random vector based on univariate conditional specifications. These conditional specifications are based on Markovian properties such that the conditional distribution of a component of the random vector depends only on a set of neighbors. Conditional autoregressive models are particular cases of Markov random fields. CAR models have been applied in different areas of science; some examples are image analysis, epidemiology, and agriculture. Typically, Gaussian CAR specifications are used as latent structures in hierarchical models for areal level data. In this case, the region of interest is divided into a set of disjoint areas and a CAR random effect is used to account for possible correlation among observations made across the different areas.}
