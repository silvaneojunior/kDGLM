#' Basic structural blocks
#'
#' Creates the basic structure for a dlm block with desired order.
#'
#' @param ... Named values for the planning matrix.
#' @param order integer: The order of the structure. Must be positive
#' @param name character: An optional argument providing the name for this block. Can be useful to identify the models with meaningful labels, also, the name used will be used in some auxiliary functions.
#' @param D array, matrix, vector or scalar: The values for the discount factors associated with the latent states at each time. If D is an array, its dimensions should be n x n x t, where n is the order of the polynomial block and t is the length of the outcomes. If D is a matrix, its dimensions should be n x n and the same discount matrix will be used in all observations. If D is a vector, it should have size t and it is interpreted as the discount factor at each observed time (same discount for all variable). If D is a scalar, the same discount will be used for all latent states at all times.
#' @param h matrix, vector or scalar: A drift to be add after the temporal evolution (can be interpreted as the mean of the random noise at each time). If a matrix, its dimension should be n x t, where n is the number of latent states (i.e., the order) and t is the length of the series. If a vector, it should have size t, and each value will be applied to the first latent state (the one which affects the linear predictors) in their respective time. If a scalar, the passed value will be used for the first latent state at each time.
#' @param H array, matrix, vector or scalar: The values for the covariance matrix for the noise factor at each time. If H is an array, its dimensions should be n x n x t, where n is the order of the polynomial block and t is the length of the series. If H is a matrix, its dimensions should be n x n and its values will be used for each time. If H is a vector or scalar, a discount factor matrix will be created as a diagonal matrix with the values of H in the diagonal.
#' @param a1 vector or scalar: The prior mean for the latent states associated with this block at time 1. If a1 is a vector, its dimension should be equal to the order of the polynomial block. If a1 is a scalar, its value will be used for all latent states.
#' @param R1 matrix, vector or scalar: The prior covariance matrix for the latent states associated with this block at time 1. If R1 is a matrix, its dimensions should be n x n. If R1 is a vector or scalar, a covariance matrix will be created as a diagonal matrix with the values of R1 in the diagonal.
#' @param monitoring vector: A vector of flags indicating which variables should be monitored (if automated monitoring is used). Its size should be n. The default is that only the first order component of this structure should be monitored.

#' Creates the structure for a Auto Regressive (AR) block (see \insertCite{WestHarr-DLM;textual}{kDGLM}, chapter 9) with desired order.
#' As the package suppose that the structure of the model is linear, a linearization is applied to the evolution equation, as described in \insertCite{WestHarr-DLM;textual}{kDGLM}, chapter 13.
#' This block also supports Transfer Functions, being necessary to specify the associated pulse when calling the TF_block function (see arg.).
#'
#' @param ... Named values for the planning matrix.
#' @param X Vector or scalar: An argument providing the values of the covariate X_t.
#' @param order Positive integer: The order of the AR block.
#' @param noise.var Non-negative scalar: The variance of the white noise added to the latent state.
#' @param noise.disc Vector or scalar: The value for the discount factor associated with the current latent state.

#' @param X Vector or scalar: An argument providing the values for the pulse for a Transfer Function.
#' @param name String: An optional argument providing the name for this block. Can be useful to identify the models with meaningful labels, also, the name used will be used in some auxiliary functions.
#' @param AR.support String: Either "constrained" or "free" (default). If AR.support is "constrained", then the AR coefficients will be forced to be on the interval (-1,1), otherwise, the coefficients will be unrestricted. Beware that, under no restriction on the coefficients, there is no guarantee that the estimated coefficients will imply in a stationary process, furthermore, if the order of the AR block is greater than 1. As such the restriction of the coefficients support is only available for AR blocks with order equal to 1.
#' @param h Vector or scalar: A drift to be add in the states after the temporal evolution (can be interpreted as the mean of the random noise at each time). If a vector, it should have size t, and each value will be applied in their respective time. If a scalar, the passed value will be used for all observations.

#' @param D.coef Array, Matrix, vector or scalar: The values for the discount factors associated with the AR coefficients at each time. If D.coef is an array, its dimensions should be n x n x t, where n is the order of the AR block and t is the length of the outcomes. If D.coef is a matrix, its dimensions should be n x n and the same discount matrix will be used in all observations.

If a1.coef is a scalar, its value will be used for all coefficients. If the coefficients are restricted to the interval (-1,1), the a1.coef is interpreted as the mean for atanh(rho), where rho is the AR coefficient.
#' @param R1.coef Matrix, vector or scalar: The prior covariance matrix for the coefficients associated with this block at time 1. If R1.coef is a matrix, its dimensions should be n x n, where n is the order of the AR block. If R1.coef is a vector or scalar, a covariance matrix will be created as a diagonal matrix with the values of R1.coef in the diagonal.

If H.pulse is an array, its dimensions should be n x n x t, where n is the number of pulses and t is the length of the outcomes.

#' noise_block
#'
#' Creates the structure for a Noise block. This block represents an independent random noise that should be added to the linear predictor.
#' The variance of the noise cannot be formally estimated, as such we use a discount strategy similar to that of \insertCite{WestHarr-DLM;textual}{kDGLM} to specify it.
#'
#' @param ... Named values for the planning matrix.
#' @param X Vector or scalar: An argument providing the values of the covariate X_t.
#' @param name String: An optional argument providing the name for this block. Can be useful to identify the models with meaningful labels, also, the name used will be used in some auxiliary functions.
#' @param D scalar or vector: A sequence of values specifying the desired discount factor for each time. It should have length 1 or t, where t is the size of the series. If both D and H are specified, the value of D is ignored.
#' @param R1 scalar: The prior variance of the noise.
#' @param H scalar: The variance of the noise. If both D and H are specified, the value of D is ignored.
#'
#' @return A dlm_block object containing the following values:
#' \itemize{
#'    \item FF Array: A 3D-array containing the regression matrix for each time. Its dimension should be n x k x t, where n is the number of latent states, k is the number of linear predictors in the model and t is the time series length.
#'    \item FF.labs Matrix: A n x k character matrix describing the type of value of each element of FF.
#'    \item G Matrix: A 3D-array containing the evolution matrix for each time. Its dimension should be n x n x t, where n is the number of latent states and t is the time series length.
#'    \item G.labs Matrix: A n x n character matrix describing the type of value of each element of G.
#'    \item D Array: A 3D-array containing the discount factor matrix for each time. Its dimension should be n x n x t, where n is the number of latent states and t is the time series length.
#'    \item H Array: A 3D-array containing the covariance matrix of the noise for each time. Its dimension should be the same as D.
#'    \item a1 Vector: The prior mean for the latent vector.
#'    \item R1 Matrix: The prior covariance matrix for the latent vector.
#'    \item var.names list: A list containing the variables indexes by their name.
#'    \item order Positive integer: Same as argument.
#'    \item n Positive integer: The number of latent states associated with this block (2).
#'    \item t Positive integer: The number of time steps associated with this block. If 1, the block is compatible with blocks of any time length, but if t is greater than 1, this block can only be used with blocks of the same time length.
#'    \item k Positive integer: The number of outcomes associated with this block. This block can only be used with blocks with the same outcome length.
#'    \item pred.names Vector: The name of the linear predictors associated with this block.
#'    \item monitoring Vector: The combination of monitoring, monitoring and monitoring.pulse.
#'    \item type Character: The type of block (Noise).
