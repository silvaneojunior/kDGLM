<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>Until now, we have presented the tools for creating the structure of
a DGLM model, specifically, we have shown how to define the relationship
between the latent vector <span class="math inline">\(\theta_t\)</span>
and the linear predictors <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_t\)</span>, along with the temporal
dynamic of <span class="math inline">\(\theta_t\)</span>. Now we proceed
to define the observational model for <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> and the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\eta_t\)</span>, the parameters for the
observational model, i.e., the highlighted part of the following
equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\require{color}
\begin{align}
\color{red}{Y_t|\eta_t }&amp;{\color{red}\sim
\mathcal{F}\left(\eta_t\right),}\\
{\color{red}g(\eta_t) }&amp;{\color{red}=
\lambda_{t}}=F_t'\theta_t,\\
\theta_t &amp;=G_t\theta_{t-1}+\omega_t,\\
\omega_t &amp;\sim \mathcal{N}_n(h_t,W_t),
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>In each subsection, we will assume that the linear predictors are
already defined, along with all the structure that must come along with
them (i.e., we will take for granted the part that is not highlighted),
moreover, we also assume that the user have created the necessary amount
of linear predictors for each type of outcome (we will see, in each
case, what that amount is) and that those linear predictors were named
as <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_1\)</span>,â€¦,<span class="math inline">\(\lambda_k\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="normal-case">Normal case<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#normal-case"></a>
</h2>
<p>In some sense, we can think of this as the most basic case, at least
in a theoretical point of view, since the Kalman Filter was first
developed for this specific scenario. Indeed, if we have a
<strong>static</strong> observational variance/covariance matrix (even
if unknown), we fall within the DLM class, which has an exact analytical
solution for the posterior of the latent states. With some adaptations,
one can also have some degree of temporal dynamic for the
variance/covariance matrix (see <span class="citation">West and Harrison
(<a href="#ref-WestHarr-DLM">1997</a>)</span>, section 10.8). Yet, our
package goes a step further, offering the possibility for predictive
structure for both the mean and the observational variance/covariance
matrix, allowing even the inclusion of dynamic regressions, seasonal
patterns, autoregressive components, etc., for <strong>both</strong>
parameters.</p>
<p>We will present this case in two contexts: the first, which is a
simply implementation of the Kalman Filter and Smoother, deals with data
coming from an Normal distribution (possibly multivariated) with unknown
mean and known variance/covariance matrix; the second deals with data
coming from a univariate Normal distribution with unknown mean and
unknown variance.</p>
<p>Also, at the end of the second subsection, we present an extension to
the bivariated Normal distribution with unknown mean and unknown
covariance matrix. A study is being conducted to expand this approach to
the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-variated case, for any
arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="normal-outcome-with-known-variance">Normal outcome with known variance<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#normal-outcome-with-known-variance"></a>
</h3>
<p>Suppose that we have a sequence of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-dimensional vectors <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(Y_t=(Y_{1t},...,Y_{kt})'\)</span>. We assume
that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
Y_t|\mu_t,V &amp;\sim \mathcal{N}_k\left(\mu_t,V\right),\\
\mu_{it}&amp;=\lambda_{it}, i=1,...,k,\\
\end{align}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is a known
symmetric, definite positive <span class="math inline">\(k\times
k\)</span> matrix. Also, for this model, we assume that the link
function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is the identity
function.</p>
<p>To create an outcome for this model, we can make use of the
<code>Normal</code> function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/Normal.html">Normal</a></span><span class="op">(</span></span>
<span>  <span class="va">mu</span>,</span>
<span>  V <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">NA</span>,</span>
<span>  Tau <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">NA</span>,</span>
<span>  Sigma <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">NA</span>,</span>
<span>  Sd <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">NA</span>,</span>
<span>  <span class="va">data</span></span>
<span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Intuitively, the <code>mu</code> argument must be a character vector
of size <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> containing the names of
the linear predictors associated with each <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{i.}\)</span>. The user must also specify one
(and only one) of <code>V</code>, <code>Tau</code>, <code>Sigma</code>
or <code>Sd</code>. If the user provides <code>V</code> or
<code>Sigma</code>, <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is assumed to
be that value; if the user provides <code>Tau</code>, <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is assumed to be the inverse of the
given matrix (i.e., <code>Tau</code> is the precision matrix); if the
user provides <code>Sd</code>, <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is
assumed to be such that the standard deviation of the observations is
equal to the main diagonal of <code>Sd</code> and the correlation
between observations is assumed the be equal to the off-diagonal
elements of <code>Sd</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>data</code> argument must be a <span class="math inline">\(T \times k\)</span> matrix containing the values
of <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> for each observation. Notice
that each line <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> must be the values
of all categories in time <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and
each column <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> must represent the
values of a category <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> through
time.</p>
<p>Next, we present a brief example for the usage of this outcome for a
univariate outcome (the general case works similarly). We use some
functions described in the previous sections, as well as some functions
that will be presented later on, for now, let us focus only on the usage
of the <code>Normal</code> function.</p>

<p>Notice that, since this is the univariate case, the <code>data</code>
argument can be a vector.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="univariated-normal-outcome-with-unknown-variance">Univariated Normal outcome with unknown variance<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#univariated-normal-outcome-with-unknown-variance"></a>

<p>For this type of outcome, we assume that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
Y_t|\mu_t,\tau_t &amp;\sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu_t,\tau_t^{-1}\right),\\
\mu_{t}&amp;=\lambda_{1t},\\
\ln\{\tau_{t}\}&amp;=\lambda_{2t}.\\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>To create an outcome for this model, we also make use of the
<code>Normal</code> function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/Normal.html">Normal</a></span><span class="op">(</span></span>

<span>  Sd <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">NA</span>,</span>
<span>  <span class="va">data</span></span>
<span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Just as before, the <code>mu</code> argument must be a character
representing the name of the linear predictor associated with <span class="math inline">\(\mu_t\)</span>. The user must also specify one
(and only one) of <code>V</code>, <code>Tau</code>, <code>Sigma</code>
or <code>Sd</code>, which must be a character string representing the
name of the linear predictor associated with <span class="math inline">\(\tau_t^{-1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\tau_t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\tau_t^{-1}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\tau_t^{-1/2}\)</span>, respectively.</p>
<p>Similar to the known variance case, we allow multiple
parametrizations observational variance. Specifically, if the user
provides <code>V</code> or <code>Sigma</code>, we assume that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{2t}=\ln\{\sigma^2_{t}\}=-\ln\{\tau_t\}\)</span>;
if the user provides <code>Sd</code>, we assume that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{2t}=\ln\{\sigma_{t}\}=-\ln\{\tau_t\}/2\)</span>;
if the user provides <code>Tau</code>, then the default parametrization
is used, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{2t}=\ln\{\tau_t\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <code>data</code> argument must be a <span class="math inline">\(T \times 1\)</span> matrix containing the values
of <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> for each observation. If
<code>data</code> is a vector, we assume that <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> is univariated and each coordinate of
<code>data</code> represents the observed value at each time. If a value
of data is not available (<code>NA</code>) for a specific time, the
package will consider that there was no observation at that time, such
that the update step of the filtering algorithm will be skipped.</p>

<p>Currently, we also support models with bivariate Normal outcomes. In
this scenario we assume the following model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
Y_t|\mu_{t},V_t &amp;\sim \mathcal{N}_2\left(\mu_t,V_t\right),\\
\mu_t&amp;=\begin{bmatrix}\mu_{1t}\\ \mu_{1t}\end{bmatrix},\\
V_t&amp;=\begin{bmatrix}\tau_{1t}^{-1} &amp;
\sqrt{\tau_{1t}\tau_{2t}}\rho\\ \sqrt{\tau_{1t}\tau_{2t}}\rho &amp;
\tau_2^{-1}\end{bmatrix},\\
\mu_{it}&amp;=\lambda_{it}, i=1,2\\
\tau_{it}&amp;=\ln\{\lambda_{(i+2)t}\}, i=1,2\\
\rho_{t}&amp;=\tanh\{\lambda_{5t}\}.\\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Notice that <span class="math inline">\(\rho_t\)</span> represents
the <strong>correlation</strong> (and <strong>not</strong> the
covariance) between the series at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and, to guarantee that <span class="math inline">\(\rho_t \in (-1,1)\)</span>, we use the Inverse
Fisher transformation (also known as the hyperbolic tangent function) as
link function.</p>
<p>For those models, <code>mu</code> must be a character vector,
similarly to the case where <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is
known, and <code>V</code>, <code>Tau</code>, <code>Sigma</code> and
<code>Sd</code> must be a <span class="math inline">\(2 \times
2\)</span> character matrix. The diagonal elements are interpreted as
the linear predictors associated with the precisions, variances or
standard deviations, respectively, while the off diagonal elements must
be equals (one of then can be equal to <code>NA</code>) and will be
interpreted as the linear predictor associated with <span class="math inline">\(\rho_t\)</span>.</p>
<p>Bellow we present an example for the bivariate case. We use some
functions described in the previous sections, as well as some functions
that will be presented later on, for now, let us focus only on the usage
of the <code>Normal</code> function.</p>

(represented by <code>atanh.rho</code>, i.e., the plot shows <span class="math inline">\(\tanh^{-1}(\rho)\)</span>) is significant and
changes over time, making the proposed model much more adequate than two
independent Normal models (one for each outcome).</p>

<h2 id="poisson-case">Poisson case<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#poisson-case"></a>
</h2>
<p>In this case, we assume the following observational model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
Y_t|\eta_t &amp;\sim Poisson\left(\eta_t\right),\\
\ln(\eta_t) &amp;=\lambda_{t}.
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>In the notation introduced before, we have that our link function
<span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is the (natural) logarithm
function.</p>
<p>To define such observational model, we offer the <code>Poisson</code>
function, whose usage is presented bellow:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/Poisson.html">Poisson</a></span><span class="op">(</span></span>

<span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As usual in the literature, we refer to the rate parameter of the
Poisson distribution as <code>lambda</code> (although, in the context of
this document, this might seem confusing) and the user must provide for
this argument the name of the linear predictor associated with this
parameter.</p>
<p>For the argument <code>data</code> the user must provide a sequence
of numerical values consisting of the observed values of <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> at each time. Since the <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> is a scalar for all <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, the user can pass the outcome as a
vector or as a matrix with a single column. If a value of data is not
available (<code>NA</code>) for a specific time, the package will
consider that there was no observation at that time, such that the
update step of the filtering algorithm will be skipped.</p>
<p>Lastly, the <code>offset</code> argument is optional and can be used
to provide a measure of the scale of the data. If the offset is provided
and is equal to <span class="math inline">\(E_t\)</span>, then we will
fit a model assuming that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
Y_t|\theta_t &amp;\sim Poisson\left(\eta_tE_t\right),\\
\ln(\eta_t) &amp;=\lambda_{t}.
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Bellow we present an example of the usage of this outcome. We use
some functions described in the previous section, as well as some
functions that will present later on, for now, let us focus only on the
usage of the <code>Poisson</code> function.</p>

<p>Notice that, while creating the structure, we defined a linear
predictor named <code>rate</code>, whose behavior is being explained by
a second order polynomial trend and seasonal component defined by a
second order harmonic block. Since the value passed to <code>rate</code>
equals <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> in both blocks, we have
that these components have a constant effect (and equal to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>) on the linear predictor on all times,
although <strong>the components themselves change their values over
time</strong> such as to capture the behavior of the series.</p>
<p>Later on, when creating the outcome, we pass the name
<code>'rate'</code> as the linear predictor associated with
<code>lambda</code>, the rate (or mean) parameter of the Poisson
distribution.</p>
<p>This is a particularly simply usage of the package, the Poisson
kernel being the one with the smallest amount of parameters. Moving
forward, we will present outcomes whose specification can be a bit more
complex.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="gamma-case">Gamma case<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#gamma-case"></a>
</h2>
<p>In this subsection we will present the Gamma case, in which we assume
the following observational model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
Y_t|\alpha_t,\beta_t &amp;\sim
\mathcal{G}\left(\alpha_t,\beta_t\right),\\
\ln\{\alpha_t\}&amp;=\lambda_{1t},\\
\ln\{\beta_t\}&amp;=\lambda_{2t}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>For this outcome we have a few variations. First, thereâ€™s a matter of
parametrization. We allow the user to define the model by any non
redundant pair of:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\alpha_t&amp;,\\
\beta_t&amp;,\\
\phi_t&amp;=\alpha_t,\\
\mu_t&amp;=\frac{\alpha_t}{\beta_t},\\
\sigma_t&amp;=\frac{1}{\beta_t}.
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Naturally, the user <strong>CANNOT</strong> specify both <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_t\)</span> AND <span class="math inline">\(\phi_t\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\beta_t\)</span> AND <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_t\)</span>, as such specification is
redundant at best, and incoherent at worst. Outside of those cases, in
which the package will raise an error, any combination can be used by
the user, allowing for the structure of the model to be defined within
the variables that are most convenient (it may be easier or more
intuitive to specify the structure in the mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu_t\)</span> and the scale <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_t\)</span>, than on the shape <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_t\)</span> and rate <span class="math inline">\(\beta_t\)</span>).</p>
<p>Another particularity of the Gamma outcome is that the user may set
the shape parameter <span class="math inline">\(\phi_t\)</span> to a
known constant. In that case, the user must specify the structure to the
mean parameter <span class="math inline">\(\mu_t\)</span> (he is not
allowed to specify neither <span class="math inline">\(\beta_t\)</span>
nor <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_t\)</span>). In general, we do
not expect the shape parameter to be known, still, there are some
important applications where it is common the use some particular cases
of the Gamma distribution, such as the Exponential Model (<span class="math inline">\(\phi_t=1\)</span>) or the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> model (<span class="math inline">\(\phi_t=0.5\)</span>). The estimation of the shape
parameter <span class="math inline">\(\phi_t\)</span> is still under
development, as such, the current version of the package does not have
support for a unknown <span class="math inline">\(\phi_t\)</span> (a
version of the package with a proper estimation for <span class="math inline">\(\phi_t\)</span> will be released very soon).</p>
<p>No matter the parametrization, the link function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> will always be the logarithm function,
as such, given a certain parametrization, we can write the linear
predictor of any other parametrization as a linear transformation of the
original.</p>
<p>In the examples of this section, we will always use the parameters
<span class="math inline">\(\phi_t\)</span> (when applicable) and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_t\)</span>, but the code used can be trivially
adapted to other parametrizations.</p>

<p>Similar to the Poisson case, the argument <code>data</code> must
provide a set of numerical values consisting of the observed values of
<span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> at each time. Since the <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> is a scalar for all <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, the user can pass the outcome either

not available (<code>NA</code>) for a specific time, the package will
consider that there was no observation at that time, such that the

<p>The <code>offset</code> argument is optional and can be used to
provide a measure of the scale of the data. If the offset is provided
and is equal to <span class="math inline">\(E_t\)</span>, then we will
fit a model assuming that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<p>Note that the above model implies that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathbb{E}[Y_t|\theta_t]=\frac{\alpha_t}{\beta_t}E_t.
\]</span></p>
<p>The arguments <code>phi</code>, <code>mu</code>, <code>alpha</code>,
<code>beta</code> and <code>sigma</code> should be character strings
indicating the name of the linear predictor associated with their
respective linear predictor. The user may opt to pass <code>phi</code>
as a positive numerical value, it that case, the shape parameter <span class="math inline">\(\phi_t\)</span> is considered known and equal to
<code>phi</code> for all <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>

</h2>
<p>Let us assume that we have a sequence of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-dimensional non-negative integer
vectors <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(Y_t=(Y_{1t},...,Y_{kt})'\)</span> and:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
Y_t|N_t,\vec{p}_t &amp;\sim Multinom\left(N_t,\vec{p}_t\right),\\
\ln\left\{\frac{p_{it}}{p_{kt}}\right\}&amp;=\lambda_{it},
i=1,...,k-1,\\
N_t&amp;=\sum_{i=1}^{k}Y_{it},
\end{align}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\vec{p}_t=(p_{1t},...,p_{kt})'\)</span>, with
<span class="math inline">\(p_{it} &gt; 0, \forall i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^k p_{it}=1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Notice that <span class="math inline">\(N_t\)</span> is automatically
defined by the values of <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span>, such
that <span class="math inline">\(N_t\)</span> is always considered a
known parameter. Also, it is important to point out that this model has
only <span class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span> free parameters (instead
of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>), since the restriction <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^k p_{it}=1\)</span> implies that
defining <span class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span> entries of <span class="math inline">\(\vec{p}_t\)</span> defines the remaining value.
Specifically, we will always take the last entry (or category) of <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> as the reference value, such that
<span class="math inline">\(p_{kt}\)</span> can be considered as the
baseline probability of observing data from a category (i.e., we will
model how each <span class="math inline">\(p_{it}\)</span> relates to
the baseline probability <span class="math inline">\(p_{kt}\)</span>).</p>
<p>To create an outcome for this model, we can make use of the
<code>Multinom</code> function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/Multinom.html">Multinom</a></span><span class="op">(</span></span>

<span>  offset <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">data</span><span class="op">^</span><span class="fl">0</span></span>
<span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For the Multinomial case, <code>p</code> must be a character
<strong>vector</strong> of size <span class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span>
containing the names of the linear predictors associated with <span class="math inline">\(\ln\left\{\frac{p_{it}}{p_{kt}}\right\}\)</span>
for each <span class="math inline">\(i=1,...,k-1\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <code>data</code> argument must be a <span class="math inline">\(T \times k\)</span> matrix containing the values
of <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> for each observation. Notice
that each line <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> must represent the
values of all categories in time <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>
and each column <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> must represent
the values of a category <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> through
time. If a value of data is not available (<code>NA</code>) for a
specific time, the package will consider that there was no observation
at that time, such that the update step of the filtering algorithm will
be skipped.</p>
<p>The <code>offset</code> argument is optional and must have the same
dimensions of <code>data</code> (its dimensions are interpreted in the
same manner). The argument can be used to provide a measure of the scale
of the data and, if the offset is provided, such that, at each time
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, the offset is equal to <span class="math inline">\(E_t=(E_{1t},...,E_{kt})'\)</span>, then we
will fit a model assuming that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
Y_t|\theta_t &amp;\sim Multinom\left(N_t,\vec{p}^*_t\right),\\
\ln\left\{\frac{p^*_{it}}{p^*_{kt}}\right\}&amp;=\ln\left\{\frac{p_{it}}{p_{kt}}\right\}+\ln\left\{\frac{E_{it}}{E_{kt}}\right\},
i=1,...,k-1.
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>At the end of this subsection we present a brief discussion about the
implications of the inclusion of the offset and how to interpret it, as
well as a explanation for the way we chose to include it.</p>

</h3>
<p>The model presented in this section is intend to describe a phenomena
such that we have <span class="math inline">\(N_t\)</span> subjects that
were distributed randomly (but not necessarily uniformly randomly) among
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> categories. In this scenario,
<span class="math inline">\(p_{it}\)</span> represent the probability of
one observation to fall within the category <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, such that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
p_{it}=\mathbb{P}(Y_{it}=1|N_t=1).
\]</span></p>
<p>In some applications, it might be the case that <span class="math inline">\(N_t\)</span> represents the counting of some event
of interest and we want to model the probability of this event occurring
in each category. In this scenario, it is not clear how to use the
multinomial model, since we will have that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
p_{it}=\mathbb{P}(\text{Observation belong to category }i|\text{Event
occured}),
\]</span> but we actually want to known:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
p^*_{it}=\mathbb{P}(\text{Event occured}|\text{Observation belong to
category }i).
\]</span></p>
<p>Notice that we can write:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
p^*_{it}&amp;=\mathbb{P}(\text{Event occured}|\text{Observation belong
to category }i)\\
&amp;=\frac{\mathbb{P}(\text{Observation belong to category
}i|\text{Event occured})\mathbb{P}(\text{Event
occured})}{\mathbb{P}(\text{Observation belong to category }i)}\\
&amp;=\frac{p_{it}\mathbb{P}(\text{Event
occured})}{\mathbb{P}(\text{Observation belong to category }i)}.
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>The above relation implies that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\ln\left\{\frac{p^*_{it}}{p^*_{kt}}\right\}
&amp;=\ln\left\{\frac{p_{it}}{p_{kt}}\right\}-\ln\left\{\frac{\mathbb{P}(\text{Observation
belong to category }i)}{\mathbb{P}(\text{Observation belong to category
}k)}\right\}.
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>If we pass to the <code>offset</code> argument of the
<code>Multinom</code> function a set of values <span class="math inline">\(E_t\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(E_{t} \propto (\mathbb{P}(\text{Observation belong
to category }1),...,\mathbb{P}(\text{Observation belong to category
}k))'\)</span>, then, by the specification provided in this section,
we have that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\ln\left\{\frac{p^*_{it}}{p^*_{kt}}\right\}=\lambda_{it},
\]</span> in other words, the linear predictors (and consequently, the
model structure) will describe the probability that an event occurs in a
specific class (instead of the probability that an observation belongs
to that class, given the occurrence of the event).</p>
<p>To obtain <span class="math inline">\(p^*_{it}\)</span> itself
(i.e.Â the probability of the event occurring given that the observation
belongs to the category <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>), one can
use Bayes formula, as long <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}(\text{Event occured})\)</span> is
known. Indeed, one can write:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
p^*_{it}&amp;=p_{it}\frac{\mathbb{P}(\text{Event
occured})}{\mathbb{P}(\text{Observation belong to category }i)}\\
        &amp;=\frac{\exp\{\lambda_i\}}{1+\sum_j
\exp\{\lambda_j\}}\frac{\mathbb{P}(\text{Event
occured})}{\mathbb{P}(\text{Observation belong to category }i)}

<p>It is important to note that in our package the Multivariate Normal
and the Multinomial models are <strong>not</strong> considered models
with multiple outcomes, but instead, they are considered be one outcome
each, such that the outcome itself is a vector (note that we made no
restrictions on the dimension of each <span class="math inline">\(Y_{i,t}\)</span>).</p>
<p>Also important to note is that our general approach for modeling
multiple time series can not, on its own, be considered a generalization
of the Multivariate Normal or Multinomial models. Specifically, if we
treat each coordinate of the outcome as a outcome of its own, they would
<strong>not</strong> satisfy the hypotheses of independence given the
latent states <span class="math inline">\(\theta_t\)</span>. This can be
compensated with changes to the model structure, but, in general, it is
better to model data using a known joint distribution than to assume
conditional independence and model the outcomes dependence by shared
structure (see <font color="red"> this article that I did not started to
write </font>).</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="special-case-conditional-modelling">Special case: Conditional modelling<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#special-case-conditional-modelling"></a>
</h3>
<p>There is a special type of specification for a model with multiple
outcomes that does not require the outcomes to be independent given the
latent states. Indeed, if the user specifies the conditional
distribution of each outcome given the previous ones, then no hypotheses
is needed for fitting the data.</p>
<p>For instance, lets say that there are three time series <span class="math inline">\(Y_{1,t},Y_{2,t}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_{3,t}\)</span>, such that each series follows a
Poisson distribution with parameter <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{i,t}, i=1,2,3\)</span>. Then, <span class="math inline">\(Z_t=Y_{1,t}+Y_{2,t}+Y_{3,t}\)</span> follows a
Poisson distribution with parameter <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{1,t}+\eta_{2,t}+\eta_{3,t}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(Y_{1,t},Y_{2,t},Y_{3,t}|Z_t\)</span> jointly
follows a Multinomial distribution with parameters <span class="math inline">\(N_t=Z_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{p}_t=\left(\frac{\eta_{1,t}}{\eta_{1,t}+\eta_{2,t}+\eta_{3,t}},\frac{\eta_{2,t}}{\eta_{1,t}+\eta_{2,t}+\eta_{3,t}},\frac{\eta_{3,t}}{\eta_{1,t}+\eta_{2,t}+\eta_{3,t}}\right)'\)</span>.
Then the user may model <span class="math inline">\(Z_t\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(Y_{1,t},Y_{2,t},Y_{3,t}|Z_t\)</span>:</p>
