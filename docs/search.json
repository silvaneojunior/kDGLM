Similar known variance case, allow multiple parametrizations observational variance. Specifically, user provides V Sigma, assume \\(\\lambda_{2t}=\\ln\\{\\sigma^2_{t}\\}=-\\ln\\{\\tau_t\\}\\); user provides Sd, assume \\(\\lambda_{2t}=\\ln\\{\\sigma_{t}\\}=-\\ln\\{\\tau_t\\}/2\\); user provides Tau, default parametrization used, .e., \\(\\lambda_{2t}=\\ln\\{\\tau_t\\}\\). data argument must \\(T \\times 1\\) matrix containing values \\(Y_t\\) observation. data vector, assume \\(Y_t\\) univariated coordinate data represents observed value time. value data available (NA) specific time, package consider observation time, update step filtering algorithm skipped. Next, present brief example usage outcome: Currently, also support models bivariate Normal outcomes. scenario assume following model: \\[ \\begin{align} Y_t|\\mu_{t},V_t &\\sim \\mathcal{N}_2\\left(\\mu_t,V_t\\right),\\\\ \\mu_t&=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mu_{1t}\\\\ \\mu_{1t}\\end{bmatrix},\\\\ V_t&=\\begin{bmatrix}\\tau_{1t}^{-1} & \\sqrt{\\tau_{1t}\\tau_{2t}}\\rho\\\\ \\sqrt{\\tau_{1t}\\tau_{2t}}\\rho & \\tau_2^{-1}\\end{bmatrix},\\\\ \\mu_{}&=\\lambda_{}, =1,2\\\\ \\tau_{}&=\\ln\\{\\lambda_{(+2)t}\\}, =1,2\\\\ \\rho_{t}&=\\tanh\\{\\lambda_{5t}\\}.\\\\ \\end{align} \\] Notice \\(\\rho_t\\) represents correlation (covariance) series time \\(t\\) , guarantee \\(\\rho_t \\(-1,1)\\), use Inverse Fisher transformation (also known hyperbolic tangent function) link function. models, mu must character vector, similarly case \\(V\\) known, V, Tau, Sigma Sd must \\(2 \\times 2\\) character matrix. diagonal elements interpreted linear predictors associated precisions, variances standard deviations, respectively, diagonal elements must equals (one can equal NA) interpreted linear predictor associated \\(\\rho_t\\). Bellow present example bivariate case. use functions described previous sections, well functions presented later , now, let us focus usage Normal function. Notice , second plot, correlation series (represented atanh.rho, .e., plot shows \\(\\tanh^{-1}(\\rho)\\)) significant changes time, making proposed model much adequate two independent Normal models (one outcome).","code":"Normal(   mu,   V = NA,   Tau = NA,   Sigma = NA,   Sd = NA,   data ) # Univariate Normal case structure <- polynomial_block(mu = 1, D = 0.95) +   polynomial_block(V = 1, D = 0.95)  outcome <- Normal(mu = \"mu\", V = \"V\", data = cornWheat$corn.log.return[1:500]) fitted.data <- fit_model(structure, outcome) plot(fitted.data) Warning in outcome$calc_pred(conj.param, if (i > t_last) {: The log-likelihood is not being calculated properly.
